# Sujiya
Sujiya mod allow you to set departure times for Cities: Skylines public transport and and generate actual graph of public transport running,setting stations as time-fixed stations or non-time-fixed stations. If the All Aboard mod is installed, then at time-fixed stations override the maximum dwell time set by All Aboard, and instead depart strictly according to the timetable defined by this mod (because in Japanese railways, departing early at a time-fixed station is considered a violation — this rule of Japanese railways is introduced by this mod). At non-time-fixed stations, departure follows the maximum dwell time as configured by the All Aboard mod.
